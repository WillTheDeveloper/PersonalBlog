title: An ecosystem for students

# My goal for this project
Before we get into the nitty gritty of the project and my plans for the future, I first wanted to give a little back-story to how the idea came about and the situation that I was in at the time that I had come up with the idea. I am going to assume that you know nothing about me so I will make sure to leave some pointers. During my time at college, I had to do a work placement and I had actually decided to take part of a work placement where we was all told that it was going to be really difficult, well long story short, it started with 12 people and finished with 2, including myself. During that project, I got exposed to Laravel which is an entire different story and quite a steep learning curve since I had never worked with any frameworks before. You can read about my experience with laravel up to yet [here](https://blog.willthedeveloper.co.uk/2022/02/13/laravel-one-year-later.html).

Anyway, if we fast forward 12 months, I am finishing my work placement with over 700 hours of industry experience in the bag. At the time of writing this I can't remember what triggered it but I had this idea to create a platform that allowed students to work together in one way or another. Teams is cool but I feel like it's tailored more towards a business environment compared to a student environment which is one of the problems I was aiming to solve by developing this application.

But, long explaination, cut short, my primary goals were as follows;
* Create a platform that students could work together in some way to get work done more effeciently.
* Enable collaboration accross all levels of study, ranging from college to universtity.
* Implement additional tools that other applications don't have to ensure that it tailors for students.
* Have something that is open source so it can be developed over a long time.

I actually bought a few domains in mind of the project and what I want it to be called.

# Current progress
We are in the year 2022 now and I have kept the entire idea and project really secretitive from like 99.7% of people. I will admit, it's been hard not to talk to people about my super ambitious idea that I have had and discuss things further including things they would want but their are a few issues with that but we won't discuss it here.

The project has been in development for a few months now and has been something I have heavily been working on alongside college. Since I had the experience from the work placement, working on this project with a framework that was awesome and had everything I need was amazing. *Almost like perfect timing.*

It has been making good progress and I think very soon it will be coming out for public beta testing or at least public release where people can start using it. You can see progress on the [repository](https://github.com/WillTheDeveloper/StudyPortal).

Alongside with the application that I have developed so far, I decided to make it more of an ecosystem kind of thing. If you don't know what I mean, they think about microsoft office and how it has all the different applications on it, something like that where I have a few different applications that specifically do different things. If you are wondering what they are then I am not sure yet, still early and I am yet to finish my current project. This will be discussed further in future plans below.

# Future plans
As I mentioned, I want to turn this into an ecosystem that students can use to do things on. Not sure what will be part of it or what is going to be added so there isnt actually much to be added here but I do have a few ideas in mind.
* Dedicated place or system to handle files that students upload or share on the platform.

*When I said a few, I think I meant one. There is such a wide scope and so much planning required that it might be a while*
