title: An interview that got handed to me

# Long story short

Before I start, I just want to mention that no names of people or companies will be stated in this story so you will just have fill in the gaps.

It was like, a few days and this week I have had to work from home (which I have hated) and it was shortly after we had finished where I found myself talking to someone from the work placement team who I have spoken to quite a lot since I have done a crazy amount of work placement hours (nearly 500) and its where I got my ~~stupid~~ good reputation for anything related to web development but that's okay!

Anyway, I then asked about a company who college in the past (post pandemic) had sent a lot of students to in the past to do like 30 hours of work placement which is the standard. It was originally just a thought and a generic question which I had no idea would end up being something bigger. This person I was talking to anyway was like "oh yeah - so I have a contact at the company if you wanted to perhaps do some hours before uni" which I *obviously* was like "yeah sure!".

Now, this is where the problem lies because up yet, if you want to know the truth. Well I have never actually wrote my CV, it was something I should have done ages ago but people eventually forgot about it and I was just CV-less. So I get asked if I had a CV and I was like "nope", with internal regret. At this point, I had two choices; Give up on this opportunity or just whip together a CV. I took the second option otherwise you would not be reading this right now!

I quite literally made my CV in about 20 minutes and was like "yep, send them this". I have done loads of things in the past so it was just the matter of listing it on a word document and making it look *pretty*. I did actually put another email on it originally which I thought I had setup to redirect to my personal email which turned out not to work so I had to put my **actual** personal email which was kinda sad.

So, they send of my CV to this "contact" at this company. Apparently the contact was "out of office", you either know what that means or you don't so my expectations of getting a reply went from a few hours (kinda ambitious) to like 3 or 4 days (pushing it) to like, frick its gonna be 2 weeks. After of which, I proceeded with my day originally planned.

Then I get a message that said "this person has mentioned you" and I was like, "huh, why mention me in a direct message chat" but then it turned out that this person saw the email and was like "yeah, would we be able to interview this guy next week" which with a person in the middle of me and the company, I told them to say "yup".

# The point I'm making

A little while before this event took place, the company was actually at the college itself, which was one thing but you know when an oppurtunity arisses even if the company is only visiting your institution. You need to ensure that you make some kind of impression because after receiving the email of the interview details, I immediately recognised the names of the people who are interviewing me, partially because I share names with one of them. So if I was to make a guess then I think a little part of the reason they jumped to getting me a interview so quickly is because of the impression I made initially by engaging and even talking to them one to one.

If it means anything, I got invited to go *on-site* which is pretty neat.
