title: How to manage your time effectively

# Time management is important
A few years ago, I wasn't the best at time management and actually I have some grey areas at the moment that require some improvement but overal my management at the moment is pretty good. This can vary from person to person where some people have superb time management and can get all their daily tasks done effectively and on time while being able to get everything else done but their is also some people who are not as good at it, which I will mention is not entirely a bad thing but if you know your not too good at it then you might want to consider introducing yourself to a method that I have started using recently that is really easy but also quite effective.

This is by no means a Google definition but the way I think of time management is the ability to have some tasks and be able to prioritise and organise your time effectively in order to get all the tasks or at least most of them done in the time that you have set yourself for each task. Your probably asking yourself, why did you just tell me your definition of it when I already know what it means, in general. Well - the point is, people may have slightly different meanings of time management and I think its important for me to define the word from a writers perspective before we continue with this article.
# A method I really like
Recently, I came across this table which is like the best and simplist way to manage your time.


|  |**URGENT**| **NOT URGENT** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **IMPORTANT** | *Do it now - Its both important and urgent so get it sorted ASAP*  | *Plan it - Keep this in mind  and arrange it for another time*  |
| **NOT IMPORTANT** | *Delegate it - See if anyone else is willing to help you with it.* | *Drop it - You should not be worrying or thinking about it.* |

The reason I really like this way of time management because in my mind I am able to think of something that I need to do and just pick a box for it to go into and hopefully this is the same for yourself. It's really easy and simple to understand but also definitive enough for you to be able to easily slot tasks into each of the columns.

To prove a point, take a moment to put these tasks in the the table above, not litterally and you may realise how easy it is.

* Complete an assignment for English that is due tomorrow.
* Organise what I am going to do for my 18th birthday that is in 4 months time.
* Write more blog posts for Will's blog.
* Backup all the photos on my phone.
* Recharge my smart watch.

# Fully contextualise tasks
Being able to fully contextualise your own tasks is important as it will help with organising everything that you need to get done.

What I mean by this is demonstated in the table below. 


| **Example 1** | **Example 2** | **Which is better?** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Do assignments     | Do my assignment for English which is due next wednesday     | The second example in this case would be better as it gives more detail allowing you to mentally compare one task to another. Removes all the ambiguity by giving a subject and a due date.  |
| Make plans | Make plans for next weekend to meet up with friends | The second example, again would be the better note that you would put in your time management table as it once again defines the general time and who. These don't need to be exact but they need to give enough context for the task that you can organise your time in a more granular way. |

Something that you should take away from this is that not only managing your time in a table is important but it also asynchronously works alongside ensuring that the definition of these tasks are done properly. When tasks are too broad, it can lead to you doing things too soon or forgetting about a very specific detail. Being able to know whats *too detailed* and whats *not detailed enough* may take some time as you develop your time management skills but as soon as you find the right balance, the outcome can be really good.
