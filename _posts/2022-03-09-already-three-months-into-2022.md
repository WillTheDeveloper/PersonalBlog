# Time flies

It has been quite a while since I wrote a blog, not sure why actually, I think I just forgot about it for a while and focused on doing other things. That includes photography too, I thought I would have like 5k photos taken by now at least but we are barely at 3k which is weird I think. 

I think it's fair to say that this year has gone really fast so far.

# Reconnecting to reality

Something I do want to talk about is the difference between this year so far and last year which could apply to some other people. Looking back, I took last year at full speed, 100mph constantly which I think might have been the wrong move but at the same time, it's hard not to with me since I have such high expectations of myself and I always want to meet them targets for me while trying to keep up with everyone else. When you are doing things so fast all the time and trying to keep up with everything, I think you lose touch with reality and end up with tunnel vision effect. It's kind of like, how an image looks different for all the different focal lengths of a camera but that is for another post entirely. In contrast, this year, things have been a lot slower to the point where I might have let myself slide a little bit but probably for the best?

When you lose touch with reality also, I think you forget about the goals that are actually meaningful to you and then get caught up with other things that might be meaningful in the moment but in the longterm don't mean anything significant whatsoever.
