title: If you have a goal
---

# The last few years
Over the last few years, I have come so far. I never visioned myself to come as far as I did but here I am. The way I had done it was by having a goal. I'm sure everyone has a goal that they want to achieve but rather than the goal itself, without proper excecution; what does it mean? A few examples I have is that, I have never done photography in my entire life until 2 years ago (Jan 2020) where I would grab the camera, day in - day out and just take photos. Some were bad and some were absolutely awful. The point I am trying to make is that, having a goal is all good but if you are not willing to excecute it over the entire period of time it takes to reach your goal then, what's the point? 

If you are not like me and can't always see the bigger picture immediately then you just need to take your goal one step at a time. It's kind of like, when you are walking from point A to point B. You can't see the goal in plain sight but as long as you know the turns and the steps that you need to take (no pun intended) then eventually you will get to the place you want to be. Along the way, you might even learn about alternative routes that you could take next time or even meet some people that have a similar goal to you and your able to support one another.
# Some tips

The best advice is advice that comes from someone who has experienced it already and learnt from it. I am always making myself aware of things that people have done which didn't work out so whenever it happened to me, I knew how I could lower the chances of me making the same mistake. 

* Don't have more than one or maybe two goals at any one time. If you want something or want to meet your goal bad enough, you will be willing to drop everything else (metaphorically) to allow you to solely focus on what you want to attain. Having more than one goal, might take you twice as long for both of them and at the end of the day, there is only one of you and possibly only one version of the goal that you have in the world so make it count.
* Work towards your goal everyday. It's important that you work towards it everyday to eventually have it all pay off and you finally meet it then you can move onto the next one. When you do meet your goal, it will feel really good and it will be all worth the effort.
* Make sure your goals are relatively realistic. From the very beginning, dont be over ambitious as you will put a lot of pressure on yourself. During the process of meeting a goal, you can adjust and fine tune the parameters of the goal that you are trying to meet.
